              <p>Canada is the most educated country in the world with over half the population having qualified college degrees. 
                The Canadian education system rivals some of the best in the world and is taught in both English and French, the two 
                most global languages.</p>
              <p>Due to its high GDP spending in the education sector and strong public education systems, student outcomes are of the
                 highest standards. This further has a trickle-down effect carried over to its universities with Canadian degrees,
                  diplomas and certificates being well recognized globally.</p>
