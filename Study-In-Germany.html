                  <p>Finding part-time jobs in Germany is not difficult, there are numerous types of jobs available that do not require you 
                    to have any specific qualification such as</p>
                      <ul>

                    <p>It has been observed that a majority of International students take up part-time work while studying in Germany for 
                      their daily expenses or help cover their tuition costs.</p>
                    <p>The student visa legally allows them to work up to 20 hours per week without an additional work permit.</p>

                  <p>The law in Germany also permits International students to extend their Residence Permit and continue living there for an 
                    additional 18 months to pursue work prospects related to their field, after completion of their graduate course.</p>
                  <p>You can reach out to the Foreign Residents’ Registration Office to find out the additional documents required to 
                    be submitted to extend the permit.</p>
                  <p>You can apply for a German Residence Permit or EU Blue card once you have successfully found a job in your field, 
                      which will allow you to continue living and working in Germany.</p>
                  <p>2 years after receiving this permit you can even apply for a Settlement Permit to become a permanent resident
